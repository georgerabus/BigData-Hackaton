New Prospects Nurturing (One-Time Project)\n\n    Objective: Develop an initial contact chain to nurture any brand-new prospects. This will be a drip campaign tailored to engage and convert fresh leads into active prospects.\n    Example Campaign Flow:\n        Email 1: Introduction to DQM Connect.\n        Email 2: Highlight key features (sent approximately 3-5 days later).\n        Email 3: Invite leads to schedule a demo (sent approximately 7-10 days later).\n        Email 4: Share a client success story (sent approximately 14-18 days later).\n        Email 5: Reinforce key features (sent approximately 30 days later).\n\n2. Webinar Invites and Follow-Up (Ongoing Monthly Project)\n\n    Objective: Build a consistent email sequence around DQM Connect’s monthly webinars. The format will remain the same each month, with adjustments made only for the specific topic and date.\n    Email Sequence:\n        Email 1: Initial webinar invitation.\n        Email 2: Reminder to register (sent 1-2 days before the event).\n        Email 3: Follow-up email with the recording and additional resources.\n\n3. One-Time / Topic-Specific Campaigns (Monthly Project)\n\n    Objective: Create topic-specific drip campaigns triggered by particular actions or events. These campaigns will be scheduled and sent out on a recurring basis.\n    Example Campaigns:\n        “The 30-Second Challenge, Renewals”\n        “The Most Powerful Version of DQM Yet”\n    Campaign Structure:\n        Typically involves 2-3 emails sent 2-3 days apart.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n    DQM Connect is a brand under the parent company Vehicle Licensing Consultants (VLC), specializing in DOT compliance software solutions for the trucking industry.\n    The client currently manages everything manually through their proprietary CRM with no automation in place.\n    To reduce costs, the client is open to receiving all materials in HTML format without Thrive accessing their Constant Contact account.\n\nCould you please provide a quote for these services?

Here is a detailed explanation of the available email marketing service tiers and what's included in each:\n\n### 1. **Fully Managed Service Tiers**\nThe Fully Managed service tiers provide complete management of the client's email campaigns, covering content creation, design, and sending.
